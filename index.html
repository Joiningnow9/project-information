                    <p> I’ve made my home base in Providence, Rhode Island, with my small growing family. My journey into tech started with a degree in
                     journalism. As I started sharing my writing online, I was fascinated with how easily I could get my voice out there. I was hooked and 
                     wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs. </p>

                <div class = "half-width about-information">
                    <p> That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something
                    that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I’ve made a full switch to front-end development, where I can
                    use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code. </p>
